            Hello, I'm <strong>Shahbaz Abro</strong>, a designer and developer with a deep passion for both creativity and technology. From an early age, I was always fascinated by how things workâ€”whether it was drawing my favorite characters or learning how websites are built. This curiosity led me to explore the world of <strong>design</strong> and <strong>development</strong>, and today, I combine the two to create unique, user-centered digital experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my journey in <strong>design</strong> with Figma, where I quickly fell in love with the ability to turn ideas into beautiful, interactive prototypes. Designing became more than just a hobby; it was a way for me to communicate stories and emotions visually. Over time, I expanded my skills into the world of <strong>web development</strong>, particularly using <strong>Next.js</strong> to bring my designs to life with clean, responsive code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of creating experiences that not only look good but also feel right. Whether it's a website, an app, or any digital product, I aim to design with purpose and build with precision. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new, and I approach each one with enthusiasm and dedication.
